## About this Website: Converting Old Latvian to Modern Latvian

This website is hosted on GitHub Pages: https://artisozols.github.io/vd-jd.
It was created as part of my master's thesis, "*Converting Old Latvian (from the mid-18th to the first half of the 20th century) Texts to Modern Latvian Writing.*" The website aims to convert digital texts (or images containing text) written in old Latvian into modern Latvian.

The core of the website is a text conversion tool developed in Python. To integrate this functionality into a web environment, the JavaScript library PyScript is used, while for text recognition from images, JavaScript library Tesseract.js is used with language data model from Latvian fraktur made by V. SaulespurÄ“ns with a help of croudsourcing.
